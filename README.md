# Risk of Rain 2 Memory Card Game

A fun and challenging memory card game inspired by the popular roguelike video game Risk of Rain 2. Test your memory skills and see how many character pairs you can match!

## Game Rules
The objective of the game is to find and match all the pairs of character cards from Risk of Rain 2. The cards are initially faced down and shuffled randomly on the game board. Players take turns flipping over two cards at a time, trying to find a matching pair. If the cards match, they remain face up. If they don't match, both cards are flipped back over, and the next player takes a turn. The game continues until all pairs have been matched.
